# What is Item Builder?
The Item Builder is a powerful library developed by Blocksmith Studios that makes it easy for configurators and developers to create custom items for our plugins.
With the Item Builder, you can instantly generate items that work with ItemsAdder or Nexo all through one simple and unified system.
<Callout>ItemBuilder is one of the helpers provided by [MDLib](https://github.com/mdaffa48)</Callout>

## Item Configuration Tutorial
In this tutorial you will learn how to create an item with the help of a external plugin such as ItemsAdder, Nexo, or HeadDatabase.
Almost every configurable item on our plugins will have this format.

### External Plugin Help
#### Nexo
```yaml
something:
    material: nexo;<nexo-id>
    display-name: "..."
```

#### ItemsAdder
```yaml
something:
    material: ia;<itemsadder-id>
    display-name: "..."
```

#### HeadDatabase
```yaml
something:
    material: hdb;<value>
    display-name: "..."
```

### Full Configuration Example
This is the full configuration example to create an item with our library, keep in mind some of the options might not be available
for your selected material, for example `color` option might not be applicable to item that can't be colored.
```yaml
something:
    material: STONE
    display-name: "..."
    custom-model-data: 1001 # The custom model data of the item
    amount: 1 # Amount cannot be below 1
    lore:
      - "..."
    flags: # Found the list of ItemFlag at https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/inventory/ItemFlag.html
      - HIDE_ATTRIBUTES
    enchantments: # Format <ENCHANTMENT>;<LEVEL>
      - SHARPNESS;5
    color: # To change the color of the item, usually used for leather armor
