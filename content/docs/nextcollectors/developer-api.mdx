```xml tab="Maven"
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.muhammaddaffaa</groupId>
    <artifactId>NextCollector</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST</version>
    <scope>system</scope>
    <systemPath>${project.basedir}/libs/NextCollectors.jar</systemPath>
</dependency>
```

```groovy tab="Gradle"
dependencies {
    implementation files("${projectDir}/libs/NextCollectors.jar")
}
```

## Events
List of custom events on NextCollectors.
| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| CollectorEvent | This event is like the root event, every collector related event this class is being used. |
| CollectorCollectEvent | Called when the chunk collector collects an item |
| CollectorSellEvent | Called when player sell collector's content |
| CollectorSellAllEvent | Called when player sell all collector's content |
| CollectorSellOneEvent | Called when player sell only one item type from the collector |

## Examples
Below are multiple examples on how to use the API

### How to multiply item receives by the collector
```java
@EventHandler
private void onCollect(CollectorCollectEvent event) {
    if (true) {
        event.setAmount(event.getAmount() * 2)
    }
}
```

### How to get all player's chunk collectors
```java
private List<ChunkCollector> getChunkCollectors(Player player) {
    User user = UserRepository.getUser(player);
    List<ChunkCollector> list = new ArrayList<>();
    for (UUID uuid : user.getChunkCollectors()) {
        ChunkCollector collector = ChunkCollectorRepository.getCollector(uuid);
        if (collector != null) {
            list.add(collector);
        }
    }
    return list;
}
```
