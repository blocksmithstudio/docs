First put this code in your `pom.xml` file if you're using Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.muhammaddaffa</groupId>
    <artifactId>NextCoinFlip</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST</version>
    <scope>system</scope>
    <systemPath>${project.basedir}/libs/NextCoinFlip.jar</systemPath>
</dependency>
```

dependencies {
    implementation files("${projectDir}/libs/NextCoinFlip.jar")
}

    return statistic.getWins();
}
