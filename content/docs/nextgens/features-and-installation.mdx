## Features

**NextGens** isn’t just another generator plugin, it’s a constantly evolving ecosystem built to push the limits of the tycoon 
experience in Minecraft. Designed for performance, creativity, and scalability, NextGens introduces innovative features that 
redefine what a tycoon plugin can be.

We believe in building with the community, not just for it. Your ideas, feedback, and imagination fuel our progress. 
Join the discussion, share your thoughts, and help us shape the most advanced tycoon system ever made.

Backed by a proven, high-efficiency architecture, NextGens has demonstrated exceptional stability and performance running over 
30,000 active generators and 200 concurrent players while consuming only around 1% server thread usage (measured via Spark Profiler). 
Reliability and innovation go hand in hand here.

### NextCollectors Integration
We have designed NextCollectors to work well with NextGens, we provide a feature that will enhance your server performance, 
making it lighter and massively decreased NextGens server usage. Chunk Collector from NextCollector can now automatically collect
drops from generators without the need for the item to actually spawn in the world.
